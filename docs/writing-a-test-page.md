This is a test page to see what all is possible with this setup. The idea is to create a system where I can document my findings and learnings over time or at the very least in 2021.

## Things to do in 2021

1. Work on how to find keyword-level opportunities to optimize
2. Work on how to find #1 on scale
3. Work on finding tasks that can be achieved by Jupyter Notebooks on a routine basis
4. Work on creating Jupyter notebooks that can perform the tasks mentioned in #3
